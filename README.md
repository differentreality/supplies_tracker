# What is Supplies Tracker ?
Supplies tracker is a Django Web Application designed to help people track their supplies in a specific place. The main purpose is to automate the subtraction procedure of Î™tems in Spaces where people interact.
User manages his Spaces which include "Storages". In Storages , you can add Items , manage & track the quantity of each Item , insert not only cost of each Item but also price of future reimbursement. When an Item is picked out of Storage, quantity is reduced even if the person who picks the Item is not a user of the app.
In the company's office employees share the same Refrigerator and probably it's not easy for everyone to know what's inside when everyone is free to pick anything.
In a HackerSpace which donations are necessary members want to know cost of refrigerator's items and future profit from these items in order to fulfill Space's needs.
In this manner , Supplies Tracker wants to provide a better goods management and help people collaborate peacefully.

* The main idea is to create a mobile Application in order to interact with the web, making user's life easier.
* A dream to come true is the connection between refrigerator and a hardware device that reduces easily the quantity when picking an item. It's very exciting having access to your refrigerator  when buying home supplies or to your warehouse if you need something. In road to work, track shared supplies between coworkers.
